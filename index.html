        <div class="col-sm-6" id="initial-setup">
          <p>This guide has been developed and tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian, based on Debian 9 “Stretch”. The Raspberry Pi Foundation’s website (<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/" target="_blank">link</a>) has an easy to setup installer called NOOBS, short for New Out Of the Box Software. For this setup, you will need to connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source (capable of at least 2A, especially for directly connected hard drives), a monitor, mouse and keyboard. Advanced users can proceed with SSH, if setup on their system.<br><br>

          Please note that this guide is not necessarily exclusive to just Raspberry Pi's. For the most part, the same exact steps could be followed for an Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux distribution installed on any device, whether a PC or a Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry Pi is convenient though as it does not use as much electricity as a regular full-fledged computer.<br><br>

          Once you complete this tutorial, you will be able to access files stored on your Raspberry Pi through your smartphone or computer (compatible with Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, macOS). Essentially your Raspberry Pi will be setup to run what's called a Windows (or samba) share, which has the best cross-platform support for use as a file server.<br>

          <p>A Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian, based on Debian 9 "Stretch". It is attached to a standard 2.5 inch HDD and a 3.5 inch HDD (not shown). For maximum throughput, it is connected via ethernet to the local network.</p>

        <h2 id="install"><a name="install"></a>Install Required Software</h2>
    
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6" id="installation">
        <p>Open the terminal and run the following command to ensure all packages are up to date:
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Next install the “samba” package:
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo apt-get install samba</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Next ensure that a text editor is installed. Gedit is a good one if using a desktop environment, otherwise vim or nano work well in command-line only environments. The relevant commands to install your text editor of choice:
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo apt-get install gedit</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo apt-get install vim</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo apt-get install nano</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img id="rpi-update" src="assets/images/rpi-update2.PNG" alt="rpi-update">
          <p>Make sure your Raspberry Pi is up to date before setting up the file server!</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="file-share"><a name="file-share"></a>Setup File Shares</h2>

        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6" id="file-share-setup">
        <p>Depending on the text editor preferred, use one of the following commands to open a configuration file to setup file shares:
        <br><br>
        <a id="code">sudo gedit /etc/samba/smb.conf
        <br>[edits the file in gedit]</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
        <br>[edits the file in vim]</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">sudo nano -w /etc/samba/smb.conf
        <br>[edits the file in nano]</a>
        <br><br>
        Navigate all the way to the bottom of the file. Ignore, but do not remove the preceding text as it contains useful information for future configurations. Setup your file share with the following parameters, changing the name of the share (instead of [File-share]), comment, path and valid users according to your local setup:
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="code">[File-share]</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">comment = Shared files</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">path = /home/pi/shared_folder</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">browseable = yes</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">writable = yes</a>
        <br>
        <a id="code">valid users = pi</a>
        <br><br>
        Save changes and close the file. Make sure to change the <strong>path</strong> to the location of the folder or hard drive you want to share to your local network. The browseable option ensures that the file share can be discovered in the local network without manually entering the IP address of the Raspberry Pi. The valid users line is important for securing your file share so that no one can access your data without knowing your username and password. Use the following command to create a password for your username:
        <br><br>
        <a id="code">sudo smbpasswd -a username</a>
        <br><br>
        Remember to replace username in the command with the user that is logged in the Raspberry Pi. Finally, use the following commands to reset the samba service so that it recognizes the changes made to your configuration file:
        <br><br>
        <a id="code">sudo systemctl restart smbd
        <br>sudo systemctl restart nmbd</a>
        <br><br>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <img id="rpi-smb" src="assets/images/rpi-smb.PNG" alt="rpi-smb">
            <p>The default configuration file is located at /etc/samba/smb.conf</p>

        </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="client"><a name="client"></a>Access File Share from Client Devices</h2>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6" id="client-devices">
            <p>Now that your raspberry pi has been setup to run the file server, it is time now to view files through your client devices. These devices can include Android smartphones, iPhones, iPads, Windows PCs, MacBooks, and even Chromebooks. Instructions will vary depending on the device in question.
            <br><br>
            <a id="client-section">Android</a>
            <br><br>
            Android devices unfortunately do not have a built-in client for viewing files over the network. No need to worry though as there are plenty of high quality third-party apps available on the Google Play Store. For the purposes of this tutorial, access will be shown through <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop&hl=en">ES File Explorer</a> though there are plenty of other available options to choose from.
            <br><br>
            Once the app is installed, open it and swipe from the left to reveal the side menu. Toggle the network panel to reveal the menu and press "Network". From here you will want to touch the icon indicated in the 2nd diagram to the right. This will scan your local network for file servers. Take note of the computers that appear under "LAN". If configured properly, your raspberry pi should appear here.<br><br>
            Long press the icon corresponding to your raspberry pi. Press the pencil to edit configuration options of the file server. In particular, you will want to put in your username and password that you previously created. After this, you should be able to connect and view all your files. Note that from ES File Explorer, you are able to copy files over to your phone and do all standard file manipulation operations. You can also stream video and music files to your phone from the Raspberry Pi!
